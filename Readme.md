## Back Testing Library

This repo is one example of countless testing scripts I've written. 
If you know me its evident that I haven't discovered the magic trading strategy yet and I'm still happily employed rather than sipping beverages at the beach with my algo laptop.

Please don't expect any of my financial scripts to work out of the gate. Use them to get ideas on how to do things.

A very common issue in using a script from a few years ago is that the API's regularly change for Google Finance and Yahoo Finance. At one point neither company allowed free access to stock data through their API and I needed to subscribe to an API. Since then I've started building sample data in Google sheets and exporting it to CSV's for basic testing. If any algo starts to look promising I'd pay the money to test on a reliable API data set.
